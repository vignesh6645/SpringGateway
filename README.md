# Spring Cloud Config Gateway with Consul Discovery

 This repository contains the Spring Cloud Config Gateway, which acts as a central configuration server for a distributed system built with Spring Cloud. It also                              integrates with Consul for service discovery and registration.

 # Overview
 
•	The Spring Cloud Config Gateway is a key component in a microservices architecture that allows for centralized management of configuration properties.
•	It provides a convenient way to store and retrieve configuration files for various services in a distributed system.
•	In addition, it leverages Consul for service discovery, making it easy for services to find and communicate with each other dynamically.


# Consul Service Discovery

Consul is a powerful service discovery and configuration tool that enables dynamic service registration and discovery in a distributed system. By integrating Consul with the Spring Cloud Config Gateway, you can take advantage of the following benefits:
  
  # Microservices Architecture: 
  
   •	Consul enables a microservices architecture by providing a scalable and flexible way to discover and connect services. 
   •	Each microservice can register itself with Consul, allowing other services to discover and interact with it seamlessly.
       
       
   # Dynamic Scaling:
   
   •	With Consul, you can easily scale your services horizontally by creating multiple instances of a service.
   
   •	Each instance can register itself with Consul, and the load balancer can distribute traffic among them, ensuring high availability and scalability.
       
   # Load Balancing: 
   
   •	Consul's built-in load balancing capabilities allow for distributing traffic across multiple instances of a service. 
   
   •	This helps optimize resource utilization and ensures that requests are evenly distributed, resulting in better performance and fault tolerance.

   # Health Checking: 
   
   •	Consul can periodically check the health of registered services.
   
   •	If a service becomes unhealthy or unresponsive, Consul can automatically remove it from the service registry, preventing traffic from being routed to            it. 
   
   •	This helps maintain system stability and reliability.

   # Actuator Integration:
   
   •	Spring Boot Actuator, when combined with Consul, provides powerful insights into the health, metrics, and other management endpoints of your                      services. 
   
   •	This enables you to monitor and manage your distributed system effectively.

   # Collaboration Across Teams:
   
   •	Consul acts as a central registry for services, making it easier for different teams to collaborate. Teams can register and discover services                    independently, without direct knowledge of each other's implementations.
   
   •	This decoupling facilitates efficient communication and promotes autonomy.
       
       
 # Getting Started
 
 To get started with the Spring Cloud Config Gateway and Consul, follow these steps:
 
   •	Start Consul in development mode by running the following command in your terminal:
   
       consul agent -dev
        
   This will start the Consul agent locally on your machine, and it will be accessible at
   
       http://localhost:8500  
       
   •	Clone the repository to your local machine:
   
      https://github.com/vignesh6645/spring-cloud-consul-serviece-discovery-consul
          
   •	Configure the necessary properties in the application.yml file according to your requirements. Update the server port and add the Consul configuration.
